        <h1>RUSSIAN WARSHIP, IDINAKHUY!</h1>
        <p>
            "Russian warship, go fuck yourself"[a], originally spoken in Russian, was the last communication made during the February 2022 Russian attack on Snake Island in Ukraine's territorial waters, by border guard Roman Hrybov (also transliterated as Gribov) to the Russian missile cruiser Moskva. The phrase, and derivatives of the phrase, became widely adopted during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in protests and demonstrations around the world.[3]

Weeks later, the phrase was commemorated on a postage stamp by Ukrposhta, the Ukrainian postal service.[4] On his release, Hrybov was awarded a medal for his actions.[5] During his captivity, his family applied for a defensive trademark on the slogan.[6] On 13 April 2022, one day after the first issue of the commemorative stamp, the Moskva was hit by Ukrainian forces firing anti-ship missiles and sunk the following day.[7][8]
