    <h1><em>WAR IN UKRAINE</em></h1>
    <p>
        Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, marking a steep escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity (Maidan). The invasion has caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II,[12][13] with more than 5.1 million Ukrainians leaving the country[14] and a quarter of the population displaced.[15][16]

At the start of the war, in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of the south-eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, sparking a regional war there.[17][18] In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops along with their equipment. In a broadcast shortly before the invasion, Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views,[19] questioned Ukraine's right to statehood,[20][21] and falsely[22] accused Ukraine of being governed by neo-Nazis who persecute the ethnic Russian minority.[23] Putin also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) constitutes a threat to Russia's national security by expanding eastward since the early 2000s, which NATO disputed.[24] Russia demanded NATO cease expansion and bar Ukraine from ever joining the alliance permanently.[25] The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine, which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.[29]
